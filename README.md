# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pablo. Most of my newer repos are at [Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~srpablo), but a bunch remain here. You can get a better sense of who I am and how my brain works from [my blog](https://morepablo.com). Frontpage has a list of favorites, most are eng-related ðŸ˜„

While I've done a ton of things for ~8 companies over ~12 years, most of my personal computing joy comes from programming languages and interpreters. I've done two Advent of Codes ([2016](https://github.com/pablo-meier/advent-of-code#advent-of-code=), [2021](https://git.sr.ht/~srpablo/advent_of_code_2021#advent-of-code-2021)) where I tried a different language every day and got to ~22.
